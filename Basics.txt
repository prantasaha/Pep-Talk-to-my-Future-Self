Skills are necessary. But Philosophy is more important. This is what makes us unique, this is what makes us Human.

Live your life fully. Enjoy the Vibes. Let the vibes direct you to do the great things in your life. Live with vibe & work with steady mind

Its okay to have emotions. Dont be a machine. But dont let the emotions take control over you. Do not break in, do not show off. Nurture your Pains. 

Dont try to change the Nature. Change with it. Push your limits. Know that changing Nature & changing system are not the same thing.

No matter how wise and brilliant you become, you will fail sometime. There will be moments when your methodology wont fit in. Know those moments. This can elevate you.

Learn good things from wherever you can. Dont disrespect anyone. Try to realise that, If life is a race then not everyone starts from the same position.

Accept yourself with flaws. Do not deny them. You cant be 100% perfect. Learn to identify your misdoings. Learn to convert your weak points into strong ones.
