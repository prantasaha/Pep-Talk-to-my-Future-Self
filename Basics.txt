Skills are necessary. But Philosophy is more important. This is what makes us unique, this is what makes us Human.

Live your life fully. Enjoy the Vibes. Let the vibes direct you to do the great things in your life. Live with Vibe & work with steady mind

Its okay to have emotions. Dont be a machine. But dont let the emotions take control over you. Do not break in, do not show off. Nurture your Pains. 

Dont try to change the Nature. Change with it. Push your limits. Know that changing Nature & changing system are not the same thing.

No matter how wise and brilliant you are, you will fail sometime. There will be moments when your knowledge wont be sufficient. Know those moments. This can elevate you.
